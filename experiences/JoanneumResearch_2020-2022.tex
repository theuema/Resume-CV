\begin{tightemize}
    \item Engineered computer vision applications to enhance real-time object detection and pose estimation capabilities of a drone, using only single 2D imagery from its calibrated camera system.

    \item Constructed a robust data acquisition pipeline from a highly accurate infrared-based tracking system, utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS), to generate a suitable dataset for algorithm development and testing.

    \item Developed and deployed Docker-based containerized services optimized for NVIDIA Jetson embedded computing platforms.

    \item Prepared and delivered detailed interim reports and presentations for the FFG (Austrian research funding agency), highlighting project progress, key findings, and strategic recommendations to ensure stakeholder alignment and continued project funding.
