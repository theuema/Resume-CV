    \item Performed data manipulation, analysis, and visualization of large-scale time-series data, including SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data from individual wind turbines, integrating additional sources such as meteorological data, error logs, and maintenance records. Applied statistical and machine learning methods to classify, cluster, and interpret data, identifying performance anomalies and enhancing operational efficiency. Utilized Python with libraries such as pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, scikit-learn, NumPy, and SciPy.

    \item Developed algorithms to address critical challenges in the wind industry, such as production loss assessment, pitch misalignment detection, and performance analysis, ensuring efficiency and applicability for monthly execution across more than 6,000 client wind turbines.

    \item Introduced processes for coding standards, version control, and documentation, ensuring high-quality, maintainable, and scalable codebases, and facilitating collaboration among team members.
