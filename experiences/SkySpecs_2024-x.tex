    \item Engineered and deployed a FastAPI-driven Python microservice architecture that delivers RESTful APIs for custom data processing, analytics, and machine learning tasks.

    \item Developing a machine learning application to detect unusually high rotor blade imbalance in wind turbines by analyzing high-frequency time-series data. Leveraging predictive models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Ridge Regression, incorporating feature engineering, and hyperparameter optimization to enhance prediction accuracy.

    \item Building an LLM-based knowledge base, enabling clients to interact with their specific data analysis results. Currently evaluating low-code solutions, libraries like Langflow, and various vector storage and embedding technologies as part of a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
