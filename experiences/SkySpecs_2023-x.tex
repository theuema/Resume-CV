    \item Develop and extend algorithms to address critical challenges in the wind industry, such as the production loss assessment, pitch misalignment detection, performance analysis, and more, focusing on broad applicability and efficiency for large wind farm portfolios.
    \item Work primarily in Python to conduct data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of large-scale time-series data in combination with other data sources such as meteorological data, error, or maintenance logs.
    \item Use statistical and machine learning methods to analyze, classify, cluster, and interpret SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data of individual wind turbines, in order to enhance operational efficiency by identifying anomalies and performance issues.
    % enhance operational efficiency by addressing critical challenges such as energy loss assessment and performance analysis
    \item Lead the transition of final prototypes to production, including big-scale testing and integration into the existing software infrastructure, for monthly execution across more than 6000 client wind turbines.
    \item Enhance the engineering process by leading the introduction of a novel Python microservice architecture that serves various statistical and other computations as RESTful APIs.
